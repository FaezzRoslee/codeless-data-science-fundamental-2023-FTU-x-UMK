AHAMD FAEZ BIN ROSLEE
Abstract
This research study uses KNIME analytics to analyze the dynamics and patterns of receiving zakat from 2012 to 2019. The study uses KNIME's data analytic tools to examine eligibility requirements, distribution patterns, and changing trends. It groups beneficiaries by the type of zakat they received zakat padi, zakat fitrah, zakat wang simpanan, zakat pendapatan, zakat saham, zakat perniagaan, zakat emas/perak, zakat harta, zakat qadha, zakat pertanian, and zakat ternakan. The study also uses KNIME's visual analytics capabilities to illustrate variations in Zakat on receiving patterns. The findings provide an understanding of Zakat receiving and policymakers to maximize the effectiveness of Zakat donations. The study highlights KNIME's potential as a flexible tool for data-driven research in religious charity and social welfare.
Introduction
One of the bases of Islam is zakat. Every Muslim who is financially secure is required to give zakat to the people who in need. Every Muslim should pay zakat as a form of prayer to assist those in need Muslims. Zakat is frequently referenced in the Quran. What Does zakat mean and what does it mean in Islam? 
“And be steadfast in prayer and regular in charity: And whatever good ye send forth for your souls before you, ye shall find it with Allah” (Qur’an 2:110)
Paying zakat is intended to cleanse wealth. Therefore, those Muslims who are wealthy must donate a small sum, or 2.5% of their income, to the needy. Wealthy individuals have a responsibility to aid the underprivileged society in whatever manner they can. Zakat is a requirement, not a free act of kindness. Zakat is a yearly tax that Muslims pay to cleanse their wealth and ask Allah for blessings.
Zakat must be paid on any extra cash in your pocket. This consists of: 
i.	Zakat Padi
ii.	Zakat Fitrah
iii.	Zakat Wang Simpanan
iv.	Zakat Pendapatan
v.	Zakat Saham
vi.	Zakat Perniagaan
vii.	Zakat Emas/Perak
viii.	Zakat Harta
ix.	Zakat Qadha
x.	Zakat Pertanian
xi.	Zakat Ternakan
Methodology
The following is the research methodology used in this work to analyze, using KNIME, the dynamics of receiving zakat based on the type of zakat from 2012 to 2019. Data collection, preparation, analysis, and visualization are all part of the methods used to understand the distribution trends and patterns related to zakat padi, zakat fitrah, zakat wang simpanan, zakat pendapatan, zakat saham, zakat perniagaan, zakat emas/perak, zakat harta, zakat qadha, zakat pertanian, and zakat ternakan.
1. Data Collection:
Data Sources: The data is from dataset https://www.data.gov.my/data/en_US/dataset/terimaan-zakat-mengikut-jenis-zakat-oleh-majlis-agama-islam-kelantan-maik-yang-telah-diaudit 
Data Selection: Data specifically covering the years 2012 to 2019.
Data Variables: Amount received, types of zakat, amount from 2012 to 2019, and the total of each year that MAIK received.
2. Data Preprocessing:
Data Cleaning: For data cleaning, node row filter is used to remove Jumlah Tahunan in the table due to the node for visualization become error.
Data Transformation: For predicting the trend of zakat received, there has been transformation in the dataset. 
3. Data Analysis using KNIME:
Data Exploration: Perform initial data exploration to gain an understanding of the dataset's structure and characteristics. This includes summary statistics, data distribution, and identifying potential patterns.
Categorization: Categorize the data based on the type of zakat, distinguishing between zakat padi, zakat fitrah, zakat wang simpanan, zakat pendapatan, zakat saham, zakat perniagaan, zakat emas/perak, zakat harta, zakat qadha, zakat pertanian, and zakat ternakan.
Eligibility Criteria Analysis: The requirements for each type of zakat, identifying any changes or trends during the research period.
Distribution Patterns: Examine the receiving patterns of zakat, including the amount received by the type of zakat, years, and total of the amount received by each year.
4. Data Visualization:
Visualization Tools: Utilize KNIME's built-in data visualization tools to create pie chart, histogram, table view, and line plot.
Comparative Visuals: Generate comparative visuals to illustrate the differences and similarities between zakat padi, zakat fitrah, zakat wang simpanan, zakat pendapatan, zakat saham, zakat perniagaan, zakat emas/perak, zakat harta, zakat qadha, zakat pertanian, and zakat ternakan in terms of receiving.
